# Overview
This academic data mining project analyzes customer loan approval patterns using the HMEQ dataset, with the objective of predicting credit risk and loan approval outcomes. Various machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Naïve Bayes—were applied to extract insights and build predictive models. The project includes:
Data preprocessing and cleaning (handling missing values, data transformation)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Model development and training
Evaluation through ROC curves, confusion matrix, and classification metrics
Performance comparison to determine the most effective model

# Implementation
The project is implemented using SAS, leveraging its statistical and machine learning capabilities for the full data science pipeline. Key components include:
Data preprocessing using SAS procedures for imputation and transformation
Model training using SAS for Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes
Evaluation metrics: ROC curve, AUC, confusion matrix, and accuracy
Comparative analysis of model outputs to assess performance

# Results & Discussion
The Logistic Regression model slightly outperformed the Decision Tree model in terms of ROC score, suggesting better discriminative power. However, the overall performance of both models was comparable, with minimal differences in accuracy and other evaluation metrics. This indicates that both models are viable for credit risk prediction, with logistic regression offering a slight edge in this case.
